- In sync mode/async we skip requests that were not executed in time.  This must
  be tweakable.
- Block offsets are in blocks, but I/O size is not. Should be resolved somehow.
- Perform opt handling properly
- compilation on 64bit machine fails
- configuration_data.push_back((uint64_t)atof(iter->c_str())); float->uint64_t
  conversion? And back again?
- if ((offset.val() + request_size.val()) > BUFFER_SIZE) { - should be request
  size
- playFlag is set as a result of side effect
- Time during which to play the trace, should be implemented in a better way,
  without processed_ flag
- read(), write() should be compared
	a) to the return in the trace (if different - what do we do?)
	b) to the size submitted
- Should return values match?
- Should we use O_DIRECT to pre-read the trace? This can eliminate cache
  pollution.
