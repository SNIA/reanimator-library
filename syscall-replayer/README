			SYSCALL-REPLAYER
			================


*HOW TO RUN STRACE
------------------- 
Trace "simple-read.sys" is generated by using following command:

strace -ttt -e trace=open,close,read,write -s 1024 -o simple-program.sys ./syscall-simple-program sample-read-input.txt output.txt 

Trace "write-simple-program.sys" is generated by using following command

strace -ttt -e trace=open,close,read,write -s 4096 -o write-simple-program.sys ./write-simple-program -n <ITERATIONS> output.txt

*WARN LEVELS OF PROGRAM
-----------------------
The syscall-replayer program runs in 3 modes:
1. DEFAULT MODE (0)
	In this mode, program runs ignoring any warning or error messages.
	USAGE: ./syscall-replayer -w 0 test.ds
	USAGE: ./syscall-replayer test.ds

2. WARN MODE (1)
	In this mode, if the our replayed data is different from DataSeries
   replayed data, the program outputs the warning messages.
	USAGE: ./syscall-replayer -w 1 test.ds

3. ABORT MODE (2)
	In this mode, the program simply aborts if our replayed data is 
   different from DataSeries replayed data.
	USAGE: ./syscall-replayer -w 2 test.ds
